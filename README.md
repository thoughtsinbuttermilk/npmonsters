## User Story

As a user who loves animals

I want to connect people and families who want to foster pets

So that they can share their experiences and work together to find pets homes

I want the app to showcase pets (dogs and cats)

So that potential adoptive parents can find a match and take them in

I want likes and comments on posts

So that these pets gain visibility and have a better chance of getting adopted
